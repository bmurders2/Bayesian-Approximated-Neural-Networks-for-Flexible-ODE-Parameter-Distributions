# Bayesian-Approximated-Neural-Networks-for-Flexible-ODE-Parameter-Distributions
Working proof-of-concept for using Bayesian approximated neural networks via dropout for deriving flexible parameter distributions of ODEs using Jax. Seaborn is used to help visualize the density of outputs over the t axis and the approximated parameter distributions.
